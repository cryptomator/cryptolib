# Cryptomator Crypto Library

This library contains all cryptographic functions that are used by Cryptomator. The purpose of this project is to provide a separate light-weight library with its own release cycle that can be used in other projects, too.

## Audits

- [Version 1.1.5 audit by Cure53](https://cryptomator.org/audits/2017-11-27%20crypto%20cure53.pdf)

| Finding | Comment |
|---|---|
| 1u1-22-001 | The now revoked GPG key has been used exclusively for the Maven repositories, was designed for signing only and was protected by a 30-character generated password (alphabet size: 96 chars). It was iterated and salted (SHA1 with 20971520 iterations), making even offline attacks very unattractive. Apart from that, this finding has no influence on the Tresor apps<sup>[1](#footnote-tresor-apps)</sup>. This was not known to Cure53 at the time of reporting. |
| 1u1-22-002 | This issue is related to [siv-mode](https://github.com/cryptomator/siv-mode/). |
